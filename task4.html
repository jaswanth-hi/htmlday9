    <h1 id="abc">author details</h1>
    <p>Robert Toru Kiyosaki (born April 8, 1947) is an American businessman and author, known for the Rich Dad Poor Dad series of personal finance books. He is the founder of the Rich Dad Company, a private financial education company that provides personal finance and business education to people through books and videos, and Rich Global LLC, which filed for bankruptcy in 2012.[1]

        Since 2010, Kiyosaki was the subject of a class action suit filed by people who attended his seminars,[2][3] and the subject of investigative documentaries by the CBC,[4] WTAE-TV[5] and CBS News.[6] In January 2024, Kiyosaki revealed that he was more than $1 billion dollars in debt.[7][8</p>
    <p>Sharon L. Lechter (born January 12, 1954) is an American accountant, author, and businesswoman. She is the co-author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, and the founder and CEO of Pay Your Family First, a financial education organization.[1]

        In January 2008, Lechter was appointed to the President's Advisory Council on Financial Literacy[2] to serve a two-year term.</p>
    <h1 id="bca">SUMMARY</h1>
    <p>Throughout the book, Kiyosaki shares anecdotes and conversations that he had with his rich dad, who guided him on various aspects of money, wealth creation, and financial independence. He learns valuable lessons about the difference between assets and liabilities, the power of financial education, and the importance of taking calculated risks. Kiyosaki emphasizes the significance of acquiring assets that generate income, such as real estate and businesses, as opposed to liabilities that drain money, such as excessive consumer debt and unnecessary expenses. He introduces concepts like the cash flow quadrant, which categorizes individuals as employees, self-employed, business owners, or investors, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of each quadrant.</p>
    <h1 id="cab">Reception</h1>
    <p>
        Rich Dad Poor Dad has sold over 32 million copies[4] Upon its release, the book was an immediate critical and commercial success.[5] It was published in 1997 and sold very quickly all around the world. The book had a resurgence in popularity following its widespread acclaim on TikTok.[citation needed] The book has been translated to over 51 languages across 109 countries, and has been on the New York Times bestsellers list for over six years.[6] It launched a series of books and related products; and received positive reviews from some critics.[7] Actor Will Smith said he taught his son about financial independence by reading the book.[8] PBS Public Television station KOCE aired a 55-minute presentation of Kiyosaki titled "A Guide to Wealth" in 2006, which essentially summarises his Rich Dad Poor Dad book. PBS also honored him with an excellence in education award in 2005.[9] Donald Trump did a literary collaboration with Kiyosaki in 2006 called Why We Want You to Be Rich: Two Men, One Message, and a second book called Midas Touch: Why Some Entrepreneurs Get Rich â€” And Why Most Don't in 2011.

    <h1 id="aaa">Criticism</h1>
    <p>A competing financial self-help writer, John T. Reed, says, "Rich Dad, Poor Dad contains a large amount wrong advice, much bad advice, and virtually no good advice." He also states, "Rich Dad, Poor Dad is one of the dumbest financial advice books I have ever read. It contains many factual errors and numerous extremely unlikely accounts of events that supposedly occurred."[12]

        Slate reviewer Rob Walker called the book full of nonsense, and said that Kiyosaki's claims were often vague, the narrative "fablelike", and that much of the book was "self-help boilerplate", noting the predictable common features of such books were present in Rich Dad, Poor Dad. He also criticizes Kiyosaki's conclusions about Americans, American culture, and Kiyosaki's methods.[1]</p>
